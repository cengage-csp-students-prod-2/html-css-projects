You have already developed a responsive website for a dog grooming business. Recreate the home page using the Bootstrap framework.

## Perform the following the tasks:

1. Create a new folder named **groom-bootstrap**.

2. Create a new file in the _groom-boostrap_ folder named _index.html_. Copy the Bootstrap starter template to your _index.html_ file. Add a comment on Line 2 that includes **your name** (firstname lastname) and the **current date** (MM/DD/YYYY).

3. Integrate a Bootstrap `navbar`, `jumbotron`, and grid system to the _index.html_ file.

4. Use Bootstrap to style text.

5. Use Bootstrap to make all images fluid.

6. Use Bootstrap to specify margins and padding.

7. Create an external style sheet with at least three custom style rules. Include a comment with **your name** (firstname lastname), the **file name**, and the **current date** (MM/DD/YYYY).

8. View your new home page in a browser. Display the page in mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

9. Validate and correct your HTML file.
