You and several of your classmates have been tasked with creating a website that showcases advances in technology. You have already created a responsive website and are now considering using the Bootstrap framework. Create a new website with a minimum of three pages using the Bootstrap framework.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. As a team, work together to design a new home page and two other webpages using the Bootstrap framework.

2. As a team, determine which Bootstrap components you will use. At a minimum, use a Bootstrap `navbar`, `jumbotron`, and `grid` system.

3. Create an external style sheet with at least three custom style rules.

4. Use Bootstrap to style text.

5. Use Bootstrap to make all images fluid.

6. Use Bootstrap to specify margins and padding.

7. Use a jQuery document ready event.

8. As a team, research other Bootstrap classes that were not discussed in _Chapter 12_. Use at least one of the classes that you find.

9. View your website in mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

10. Check your spelling. Validate your HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.

> In this exercise, you used the Bootstrap, a front-end framework, to create a website. As a group, research back-end frameworks and list at least three resources that you found and the URL for each.
