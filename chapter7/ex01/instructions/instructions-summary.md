Validate your HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.
Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability.

Open the instructors.html page within a browser, and view the page in all three viewports, as shown in *Figure 7â€“78*.

- In this assignment, you add HTML 5 semantic elements. Research the `time` semantic element, identify its use, and then discuss its attribute and the different ways in which time can be displayed.
