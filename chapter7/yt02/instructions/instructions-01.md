## Perform the following the tasks:

1. Review your current pages to determine where you can replace `div` elements with `article`, `section`, or `aside` elements, and then update those elements as appropriate. Add these elements to the CSS reset style rule.

2. Review where you can integrate `figure` elements and at least three `figcaption` elements. Add these elements to the CSS reset style rule.

3. Create a new page for your website. Use your _template.html_ file to create the new page. Add the current date to the comment near the top of the page, and update the file name and the text within the `title` element. Pictures of dog groomers have been provided for you if you chose to use them.

4. Add content to your new page. Use your CSS file to style your new elements and/or create and style class attributes to style the new element content.

5. Integrate and use the CSS grid layout within your website. Include a style rule that spans an element across at least two grid columns.

6. Use the `opacity` property or `rgba()` function in your style sheet.

7. Use at least one text shadow or one box shadow within your website.

8. Create and add a `favicon` to all HTML pages within the website.

9. Validate your HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.

10. Open your webpage in a new tab and view all files with Google Chromeâ€™s device mode, and view the new page in a mobile, tablet, desktop, and large desktop viewports. Test your links to ensure they work.

11. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability.
