## Perform the following tasks:

1. As a team, review your current pages to determine where you can replace `div` elements with `article`, `section`, or `aside` elements, and then update those elements as appropriate. Add these elements to the CSS reset style rule.

2. As a team, review and discuss where you can integrate `figure` elements and at least two `figcaption` elements. Add these elements to the CSS reset style rule.

3. As a team, discuss and create a new page for your website. Use your _template.html_ file to create the new page. Add the current date to the comment near the top of the page, and update the file name and the text within the `title` element. Pictures of new technology have been provided in the _/images/_ folder if you want to use them on your new page.

4. Add content to your new page. Use your CSS file to style your new elements and/or create and style class attributes to style the new element content.

5. Integrate and use the CSS grid layout within your website. Include a style rule that spans an element across at least two grid columns.

6. Use the `opacity` property or `rgba()` function in your style sheet.

7. Use at least one text shadow and at least one box shadow within your website.

8. Create and add a `favicon` to all HTML pages within the website.

9. Validate your HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.

10. Open your website in a new tab and view all files with Google Chrome’s device mode, and view the new page in a mobile, tablet, desktop and large desktop viewports. Test your links to ensure they work.

11. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability.

> Each person in the group should research different layout design strategies for the website and present them to the group for a discussion. In the discussion, the group should review each strategy and make a decision to apply the most popular layout strategy. Organize your group’s findings as requested by your instructor.
