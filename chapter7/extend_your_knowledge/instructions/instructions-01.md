## Perform the following tasks: 

1. Open the *index.html* file and update the comment with **your name** and **today’s date**. Add your name to the paragraph element located within the `footer` element near the bottom of the page.

2. Open *index.html* in your browser to view the webpage. Maximize the browser window to use a desktop viewport. 

3. Open the *styles.css* file from the *css* folder. Modify the comment at the top of the style sheet to include **your name**, **today’s date**, and the **file name**.

4. Use your browser to research different ways to create a multiple-column layout for webpage design.

5. Use the *index.html* and *styles.css* files to create the three-column layout. Use *Figure 7–76* as guide. Do not use the CSS grid layout or CSS `width`, `float`, and `clear` properties.

6. Use the first empty paragraph element within the `aside` element to summarize the method you used to create your columns. Identify the resource you used and include a `link` to the resource that opens in a new tab. 

7. Use your browser to find an online favicon generator and create your own favicon. Save your favicon files in the */images* folder. Include the proper link elements within the *index.html* file. 

8. Use the second paragraph element within the `aside` element to note the resource you used to create your favicon. Include a link to the resource that opens in a new tab. 

9. Validate your HTML and CSS files. Correct any errors.

> In this exercise, you created your own favicon. Use your browser to research why favicons are important for search engine optimization.
