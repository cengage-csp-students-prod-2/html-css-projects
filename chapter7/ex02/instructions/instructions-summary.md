You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already developed a responsive web design website in previous chapters and now need to integrate additional HTML5 semantic elements and create a new page. The Gallery page, displayed in mobile and tablet viewports, is shown in *Figure 7-79*. The Gallery page, as displayed in desktop and large desktop viewports is shown in *Figure 7-80*. *Figure 7-80* also shows the favicon.
