In *Chapter 6*, you completed your personal portfolio website for a responsive design.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. Review your current pages to determine where you can replace `div` elements with `article`, `section`, or `aside` elements, and then update those elements as appropriate. Add these elements to the CSS reset style rule. 

2. Your `header` element contains your picture. Wrap your picture within a `figure` element and place your mission statement or tag line within a `figcaption` element. Update all pages to include this change, including your template file. Add the `figure` and `figcaption` elements to the CSS reset style rule.

3. Create a new page for your website. Use your template file to create the new page. Add the current date to the comment near the top of the page, and update the file name and the text within the `title` element. 

4. Add content to your new page. Use your CSS file to style your new elements and/or create and style class attributes to style the new element content. 

5. Integrate and use the CSS grid layout within your website. 

6. Use at least one text shadow or one box shadow within your website. 

7. Validate your HTML and CSS files and correct any errors. 

8. Launch the website in a new tab and view all files with Google Chromeâ€™s device mode, and view the new page in a mobile, tablet, desktop, and large desktop viewports. Test your links to ensure they work. 

9. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability.

> Use your browser to research the HTML 5 details and summary semantic elements. Discuss where you could integrate these elements with your site and why.
