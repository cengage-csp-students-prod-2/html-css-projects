## Perform the following tasks: 

1. Add a `table` element to one of your webpages. As a group, determine the best use of a table within the website. Use a minimum of seven rows and five columns for your table. Use at least one `rowspan` or `colspan` within your table. 

2. Determine whether to show or hide the table for a mobile viewport. If you hide the table from the mobile viewport, use a list or other element to display your table data for a mobile viewport. 

3. Update the CSS file to:
    * Style the table element for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.  
    * Style alternating rows differently.  
    * Refine your style sheet as desired.  
    * Add comments to note all changes and updates. 
    
4. Add a `form` element to your website. Include a minimum of eight form elements, including a **Submit** button. Include at least two `fieldsets` and two `legend` tags. Add the required attribute to at least two `input` elements. Add a placeholder attribute to at least one `input` element.

5. Use your style sheet to create rules for your `form` elements. Style for mobile, table, and desktop viewports. 

6. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability. 

7. Validate all HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.
