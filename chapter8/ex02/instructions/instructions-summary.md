You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already developed a responsive website in the previous seven chapters and now need to add a table and a form to the website. Use the _template.html_ file to create the Partnership page and add a table to the page. Update the Contact page by adding a form. _Figure 8-73_ shows the Partnership page in in mobile and desktop viewports. _Figure 8-74_ shows the form on the Contact page in mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
