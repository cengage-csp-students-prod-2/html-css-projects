## Perform the following tasks:

1. Add a `table` with a minimum of five columns and six rows. As a team, discuss how the `table` will be used and determine which page will contain the `table`. Include at least one `rowspan` or `colspan`. Create a new page if necessary.

2. Design the `table` as a team. Use your stylesheet to format your `table` for all viewports. Determine if the `table` is suitable for a mobile viewport. If not, hide the table for mobile and use an alternate method to display the content.

3. As a team, design and build a `form`. Create a new page if necessary. Decide what `input` controls you will use and how you will style the `form` elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. At a minimum, update the HTML and CSS files to do the following:
* Add a `form` to the page of your choice.
* Add text `input` controls, include appropriate attributes, and make at least two fields required.
* Add a `select` and `textarea` element.
* Add a `form` element not used within the chapter project.
* Add a submit button.
* Style the `form` elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. 

4. Use the embedded browser to view and the `table` and `form` for each viewport.

5. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability. Add comments when adding new style rules. 

> Research the requirements to submit a `form` to a server for processing and provide a summary of your findings.
