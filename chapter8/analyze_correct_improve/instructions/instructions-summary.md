Work with the _index.html_ file and the _styles.css_ file in the _/css_ folder. The _index.html_ webpage contains a `form` with various input controls. Wrap the `form` elements within a `fieldset` and include a `legend`. Analyze the page to determine the type of information being collected by the form and add labels for each input control. Next, create a submit button, and then style the form for mobile and tablet viewports. Use **Figures 8-69** and **8-70** as a guide to correct these files.
