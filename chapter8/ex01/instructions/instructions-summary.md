You work for a local music lesson company called Strike a Chord that provides music lessons for piano, guitar, and violin. The company needs a web presence and has hired you to create their website. You have already developed a responsive website and now need to add a table and a form to the website. Use the _template.html_ file to create the Rentals page and add a table to the page. Update the Contact page by adding a `form`. _Figure 8-71_ shows the Rentals page in mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports and _Figure 8-72_ shows the Contact page in mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
