You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. The director of Wild Rescues has asked you to build a website for the organization. The website plan, wireframe, and site map has been completed. Create a webpage template with HTML semantic elements and static content. Next, validate the template, correct any errors, and then use the template to create a home page for Wild Rescues. Finally, add content to the home page. The completed webpage is shown in _Figure 2-37_. (The paw print graphic may have a different appearance in your browser.)
