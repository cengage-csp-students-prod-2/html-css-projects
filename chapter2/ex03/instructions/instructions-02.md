## Perform the following tasks:

1. As a group, determine where you will store your website files, either locally or using a remote repository, and then create a folder to serve as the root folder for the website. Name the folder **student**. Inside of your */student* folder, create the following subfolders for the website: **css**, **images**, **media**, **scripts**.

2. Create a **template.html** file for your website and save it within the */student* root folder. Add all necessary HTML elements to the template to create an HTML 5 webpage. Your template file should include the following minimum structural elements: `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer`.

3. Add a multiline comment to your template file that identifies the group members, file name, and the current date. Insert a comment above the `main` element to identify the purpose of the `main` element and how it should be used.

4. Add static content to your template. Use appropriate text within the `title` element. Nest a `heading` element within your `header` element. If it serves a purpose, you may include a symbol within your `heading` element. Nest a paragraph element within your `nav` element that includes text for your future page links. You may include symbols between your text links. Add content to the `footer` element.

5. Indent all nested elements and add blank lines where appropriate to improve readability. 

6. Validate your template file and correct any errors. 

7. Use your template file to create your home page. Save the home page with the file name **index.html**.

8. Add meaningful content to the `main` element on your home page and change the text in the `title` element to indicate this page is the home page. 

> In *task 1*, you were to identify where your group will save files for this project. What was your decision? What will you do to ensure everyone has access to the files? How often will you backup the project files, in the event that the primary storage option is lost or unavailable?
