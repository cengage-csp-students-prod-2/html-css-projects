## Perform the following tasks: 

1. Now, create a folder to serve as the root folder for the website and name the folder **portfolio**.

2. Create a webpage template inside the *portfolio* directory with HTML semantic elements and static content. Add a multiline comment beginning at Line 2 that includes **your name** (firstname lastname), the **file name**, and the **current date** (MM/DD/YYYY). 

3. Add a comment above the `main` element to note its purpose. 

4. In the `header`, include a heading element for your name, and then add another heading element with your mission statement or tagline. 

5. In the `nav` area, include text for the links you will provide to the other webpages in the website. 

6. Validate the template, correct any errors, and then use the template to create a home page for your portfolio called **index.html**.
