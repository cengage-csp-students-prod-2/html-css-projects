## Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a subfolder within your portfolio website folder and name the new folder **images**. Save a picture of yourself within the images folder. Ensure that the image file has an appropriate file name, such as your name. Use all lowercase and no spaces.

2. Review the image file properties to ensure that the image size and file size are not too large. If your image size is greater than **500** x **500** pixels, use photo-editing software, such as Paint, to adjust the image size. Likewise, if the file size is greater than **1 MB**, use an online image file compression tool to reduce the file size.

3. Add a picture of yourself within the header element on your home page and your template file. Be sure to include all necessary attributes within the `img` element; `src`, `alt`, `height`, and `width`.

4. Open your _template.html_ file and add anchor elements to create text links within the navigation area. Though the other pages do not yet exist, use an appropriate file name for each text link. For example, if you have a navigation link for “About Me,” use _about.html_ as the file name. Update the navigation area on your home page to match the navigation area on your template.

5. Add your student email address to the footer element and include an email hyperlink to your email address. Update the `footer` area on your home page to match the `footer` area on your template.

6. Review your site map and then use your template to create a new webpage for your website. If you create a new page for “About Me”, use _about.html_ as the file name.

7. Update the comment and the `title` element on your new page. Nest a `div` element with an `id` attribute and appropriate value within your `main` element. Add relevant content to the `div` element and include a list with content relevant to the page. Use at least one ordered list, unordered list, or a description list. If using one list, it should include a minimum of five list items.

8. Create another new webpage using your template file. Use this new page for your contact information. Use an appropriate file name, such as _contact.html_.

9. Update the comment and the `title` element on your new page. Nest a `div` element with an `id` attribute and appropriate value within your `main` element. Add relevant contact information to the `div` element. Embed an online location map with the location of your educational institution.

10. Review the new pages for spelling errors and correct. Validate your new pages and correct any errors.
