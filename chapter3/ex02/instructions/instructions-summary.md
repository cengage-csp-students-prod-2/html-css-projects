You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already created the website plan, template, and home page in _Chapter 1_ and _Chapter 2_, Lab 2. You now need to add links, images, and create more webpages for the website. The Home, About Us, and Contact webpages are shown in _Figure 3-80_.
