## Perform the following tasks:

1. Upload your files from *Chapter 2* or using the command line to sync your files from a remote repository.  

2. Open your *template.html* file and add anchor elements to create text links within the navigation area. Though the other pages do not yet exist, use an appropriate file name for each text link. For example, if you have a navigation link for “Clubs”, use *clubs.html* as the file name. Update the navigation area on your home page to match the navigation area on your *template.html* file.

3. In the template file, nest an empty `div` element within the `main` element.

4. Add an email link to the email address within the `footer` element in the *template.html* file and the *index.html*. 

5. In the *template.html* file, in the `footer` element, add a paragraph element with the name of your educational institution and link the text to the home page of your educational institution’s website. Configure the link to open in a new tab. Update the `footer` element on your home page to match the `footer` element on your **template.html** file.

6. In the *index.html* file, in the `main` element, wrap all elements within a `div` element with an `id` attribute value of **welcome**. Indent the nested elements within the `div` element. 

7. Nest an image within the `welcome` `div` element. You may use one of the image files provided or add your own. Use descriptive `alt` text and include the proper `height` and `width` attributes. If your image is greater than **500** x **500** pixels, use graphic software to resize the image. If the file size is greater than **1 MB**, use an online image compressor tool to reduce the file size. 

Indent all nested elements and save your changes

8. Review your site map and then use your template to create a new webpage for your website. Save your new webpage with an appropriate file name. For example, if you create a new page for “Clubs”, use *clubs.html* as the file name. As a group, discuss what content will you add to this page.


9. Update the comment and `title` on the new webpage. Assign an `id` attribute and value to the `div` within the `main` element, then add content to this `div`. Content should include at least one heading element, at least one paragraph element, an image with all appropriate attributes, and a list (ordered, unordered, or description). Add an absolute link to the webpage that opens another website in a new tab.
