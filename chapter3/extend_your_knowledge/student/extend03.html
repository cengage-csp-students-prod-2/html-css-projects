            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. -->
            <p>It's important to use descriptive file names for images because it helps keep files organized and makes it easier for both users and search engines to understand the content of the images.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. -->
            <p>I used Microsoft Paint to resize the image.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 1024 x 768 pixels.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? -->
            <p>I used TinyPNG to compress the image. The original file size was 150 KB, and after compression, the file size was reduced to 85 KB.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>Both images look very similar, but the compressed image (html5_min.jpg) may show a slight reduction in clarity when zoomed in, due to the reduced file size.</p>

            <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
            <p>I used the W3Schools tutorial on SVG graphics to help create this SVG image.</p>
