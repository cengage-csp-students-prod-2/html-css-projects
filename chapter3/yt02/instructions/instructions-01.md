## Perform the following tasks:

1. Review the image file properties to ensure that the image file sizes are not too large. If any file size is greater than 1 MB, use an online image file compression tool to reduce the file size.

2. Copy or move the image files from the _/resources_ folder to the _/groom/images/_ folder using the following command:

```bash
mv ./resources/* ./groom/images/
```

3. Add the _dog-banner.jpg_ image file within the `header` element, below the heading elements, on your home page and your template file. Be sure to include all necessary attributes within the `img` element; `src`, `alt`, `height`, and `width`.

4. Open your _template.html_ file and add anchor elements to create text links within the navigation area. Though the other pages do not yet exist, use an appropriate file name for each text link. For example, if you have a navigation link for “Services”, use _services.html_ as the file name. Update the navigation area on your home page to match the navigation area on your template.

5. If necessary, add an email address to the `footer` element and include an email hyperlink to the email address. Update the `footer` area on your home page to match the `footer` area on your template.

6. Nest an empty `div` element within the `main` element on the _template.html_ file. In the _index.html_ file, wrap all elements within the `main` element in a `div` with an `id` attribute and appropriate value.

7. Review your site map and then use your template to create a new webpage for your website. Use an appropriate file name. For example, if you create a new page for “Services” use _services.html_ as the file name.

8. Update the comment and the `title` element on your new page. Update the `div` element with an `id` attribute and appropriate value within your `main` element. Add relevant content to the `div` element and include a list with content relevant to the page. Include at least two lists with relevant content. You can use one type of list or a combination of lists; an ordered list, unordered list, or description list. Each list should have a minimum of three list items.

9. Add at least two images to your new page. You may use the images provided or your own images. Be sure to include all necessary attributes within the `img` element; `src`, `alt`, `height`, and `width`.

10. Create another new webpage using your template file. Use this new page for contact information for the dog-grooming business. Use an appropriate file name, such as _contact.html_.

11. Update the comment and the `title` element on your new page. Update the `div` element with an `id` attribute and appropriate value within your `main` element. Add relevant contact information to the `div` element. Embed an online location map with the location of the dog-grooming business. You may use the address of your education institution or a city and state.

12. Review the new pages for spelling errors and correct. Validate your new pages and correct any errors.
