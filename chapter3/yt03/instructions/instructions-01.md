## Perform the following tasks:

1. Review the image files provided for you in the */resources* folder. Move the files into the */images* folder of the your */tech* directory using the following command: 

```
mv ./resources/* ./tech/images/
```

Ensure that the image file sizes are not too large. If any file size is greater than **1 MB**, use an online image file compression tool to reduce the file size. 

2. Add an image file on your home page. You may use one of the images provided with the data files or your own image. Be sure to include all necessary attributes within the `img` element; `src`, `alt`, `height`, and `width`.

3. Open your *template.html* file and add anchor elements to create text links within the navigation area. Though the other pages do not yet exist, use an appropriate file name for each text link. For example, if you have a navigation link for “AI”, use *ai.html* as the file name. Update the navigation area on your home page to match the navigation area on your template. 

4. If necessary, add an email address to the `footer` element and include an email hyperlink to the email address. Update the `footer` area on your home page to match the `footer` area on your template.

5. Nest an empty `div` element within the `main` element in the *template.html* file. In the *index.html* file, wrap all elements within the `main` element in a `div` with an `id` attribute and appropriate value.

6. Review your site map and then use your template to create a new webpage for your website. Use an appropriate name. For example, if you create a new page for “AI” use *ai.html* as the file name. As a group, discuss what content will you add to this page.

7. Update the comment and the `title` element on your new page. Update the `div` element with an `id` attribute and appropriate value within your `main` element. Add relevant content to the `div` element. Provide a definition of the technology as well as several examples. Include a list (ordered, unordered, or description) with content relevant to the page. The list should have a minimum of three list items.  

8. Include at least three absolute links that open in a new tab.

9. Add an image to your new page. You may use one of the images provided. Be sure to include all necessary attributes within the `img` element; `src`, `alt`, `height`, and `width`.

10. Use your *template.html* file to create another webpage for your website. Use this new page to discuss another technology identified in your site map. Use an appropriate file name.
 
11. Update the comment and the `title` element on your new page. Update the `div` element with an `id` attribute and appropriate value within your `main` element. Add relevant content to the `div` element. Include at least two absolute links that open in a new tab.

12. Review the new pages for spelling errors and correct. Validate your new pages and correct any errors.

> In this assignment, you added absolute links to content related to your website. Is it possible to embed a video on your page as well? If so, what element would be used to accomplish this task?
