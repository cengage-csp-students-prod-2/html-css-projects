## Task 02
Open *index.html*  in Google Chrome’s device mode and resize the page to the current breakpoint for the tablet media query, which is **481px**. Note how the navigation links appear on two lines. Use Google Chrome’s device mode to determine the smallest breakpoint that shows the navigation links on the same line. 

In the *styles.css* file, modify the tablet media query with a more suitable breakpoint value that displays the navigation links on the same line.
