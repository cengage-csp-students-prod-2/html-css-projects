## Perform the following tasks:
1. Add a minimum of two media queries to your style sheet; one for tablet and at least one for desktop.

2. Hide any mobile-specific content and show any tablet or desktop-specific content.

3. Use at least one dynamic `pseudo-class` in your desktop media query. 

4. Add comments in your style sheet to note where each media query begins, and add other comments for new style rules as appropriate. 

5. View and test each viewport design and adjust breakpoints where necessary. Exit device mode to view and test the hover `pseudo-class`. 

6. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability. 

7. Validate all HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.
