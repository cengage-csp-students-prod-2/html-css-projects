## Task 09
Within the desktop media query, below the `header` style rule, add a new comment with the text, **Desktop Viewport: Style rules for nav area**. Below the comment, add a style rule for the `nav li a` selector that sets the `padding` to **0.5em** on the top and bottom and **1.5em** on the left and right. 

Add another style rule for the `nav li a` selector that uses the `hover` `pseudo-class` and sets the `color` to **#373684** and the `background-color` to **#e5e9fc**.
