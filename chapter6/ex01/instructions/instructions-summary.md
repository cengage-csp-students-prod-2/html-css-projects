You work for a local music lesson company called Strike a Chord that provides music lessons for piano, guitar, and violin. The company needs a web presence and has hired you to create their website. You have already created the mobile layout, but now need to add media queries for tablet, desktop, and print layouts. _Figure 6-66_ shows the home page in the tablet viewport and _Figure 6-67_ shows the Lessons page in the desktop viewport.
