## Task 03
Within the tablet media query, add a new comment with the text, **Tablet Viewport: Style rules for nav area**. Below the comment, add a new style rule for the `nav li` selector that sets the top border to **none**, `display` to an **inline-block**, `font-size` to **1.5em**, and a right border property with **1px solid #e5e9fc**   as its values. 

Add another style rule for the `nav li` selector that uses the `last-child` `pseudo-class` and removes the right border.
