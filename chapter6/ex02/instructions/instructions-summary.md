You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already created the mobile layout, but now need to add media queries for a tablet, desktop, and print. Style the website shown in _Figure 6-68_ for the tablet viewport. Style the website shown in _Figure 6-69_ for the desktop viewport. Style the website shown in _Figure 6-70_ for a large desktop viewport.
