## Perform the following tasks: 

1. Add four media queries to your style sheet; one for tablet, one for desktop, one for a large desktop, and one for print. As a team, determine the design and breakpoint for each viewport.  

2. Hide any mobile-specific content and show any tablet or desktop-specific content.  

3. Use at least three dynamic pseudo-classes in your desktop media query. 

4. Use a gradient. 

5. Use a multiple-column layout on at least one page. 

6. Add comments in your style sheet to note where each media query begins and add other comments for new style rules as appropriate. 

7. View and test each viewport design and adjust breakpoints where necessary. Exit device mode to view and test the `hover` `pseudo-class`. 

8. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability. 

9. Validate all HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.

> So far, you have learned about and used structural and dynamic pseudo-classes. What other categories of pseudo-classes exist? Identify at least two.
