In *Chapter 5*, you designed your dog grooming business website for a mobile viewport. YouÂ now need to design it for tablet, desktop, large desktop, and print viewports.

## Perform the following tasks: 
1. Add four media queries to your style sheet; one for tablet, one for desktop, one for a large desktop, and one for print.

2. Hide any mobile-specific content and show any tablet or desktop-specific content.

3. Use at least one dynamic `pseudo-class` in your desktop media query.

4. Use a gradient for a background.

5. Use a multiple-column layout on at least one page. 

6. Add comments in your style sheet to note where each media query begins and add other comments for new style rules as appropriate. 

7. View and test each viewport design and adjust breakpoints where necessary. Exit device mode to view and test the hover `pseudo-class`. 

8. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability. 

9. Validate all HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.
 
> In this assignment, you specified a gradient for a background. Research the backgroundrepeat property and provide a summary of its use.
