## Perform the following tasks:
1. Open the *styles.css* file in your text editor and add media queries for tablet, desktop, large desktop, and print.
2. As a team, determine the design and breakpoint for each viewport.
3. Hide any mobile-specific content and show any tablet or desktop-specific content.
4. Use at least one dynamic `pseudo-class` in your desktop media query.
5. Apply a gradient.
6. Use a two-column layout for at least one page.
7. Add comments in your style sheet to note where each media query begins and add other comments for new style rules as appropriate.
8. View and test each viewport design and adjust breakpoints where necessary. Exit device mode to view and test the hover `pseudo-class`.
9. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability.

> In this assignment, you needed to determine at least three different breakpoints for your media queries. What breakpoints did you use and why?
