You have already developed a responsive website for your personal portfolio and now need to add interactivity with CSS and JavaScript to the website.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. Add a hamburger menu icon to your personal portfolio website. Use CSS to display the icon for a mobile viewport and hide it for larger viewports. Create a JavaScript file named *script.js* and use it to create a function to enable your hamburger menu.

2. Apply and use the CSS `transform` property within your website.

3. Test your hamburger menu and transform effect. 

4. Validate and correct your HTML and CSS files. 

> In this exercise, you used JavaScript to create a function. Research and explain how to use the `!=` operator in JavaScript.
