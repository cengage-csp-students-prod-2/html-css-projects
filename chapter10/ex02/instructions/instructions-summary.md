You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already created the website and now need to add a hamburger menu for a mobile viewport and create other functions to add interactivity to the website. _Figure 10-77_ shows the home page in a mobile (375px) viewport. _Figure 10-78_ shows the FAQs page in a desktop viewport.
