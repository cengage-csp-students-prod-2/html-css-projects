The _index.html_ webpage needs JavaScript functions to display larger pictures. First, correct the JavaScript syntax errors on the page. Next, create global variables. Then, use the first function as an example to create a function to display a larger image of the second thumbnail picture within the placeholder `figure` element. Also use the first function as an example to create a function to display a larger image of the third thumbnail picture within the placeholder `figure` element. Finally, create new style rules for the `figure` and `img` elements. The completed webpage is shown in _Figure 10-74_. You will also use professional web development practices to indent, space, comment, and validate your code.
