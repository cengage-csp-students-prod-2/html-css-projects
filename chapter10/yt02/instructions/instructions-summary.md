You have already created a responsive design website for a dog grooming business, but now need to add interactivity to the website. 

## Perform the following tasks:

1. Add a hamburger menu icon to the dog grooming website. Use CSS to display the icon for a mobile viewport and hide it for larger viewports. Create a JavaScript file named *script.js* and use it to create a function to enable your hamburger menu. 

2. Create and apply an `@keyframes` rule for animation within your website.

3. Test your hamburger menu and animation. 

4. Validate and correct your HTML and CSS files. 

> In this exercise, you created an animation with CSS. Research the jQuery `animate()` method and provide an overview of how to use this method.
