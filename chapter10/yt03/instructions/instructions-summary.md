You and several of your classmates have been tasked with creating a website that showcases advances in technology. You have already created a responsive design website and now need to add interactivity to the website.  

## Perform the following tasks: 
1. As a team, work together to determine how to best integrate the CSS transform property and an `@keyframes` rule for animation into the website. 

2. As a team, work together to add a hamburger menu icon to all pages within your website. Display the hamburger icon for a mobile viewport and hide it for larger viewports. 

3. Create an external JavaScript file named *script.js* and save it within your *tech/scripts* folder. Use the *script.js* file to create a function to enable your hamburger menu. 

4. As a team, work together to create and call at least one other function within your website. 

5. Update your style sheet as necessary to style your webpage elements.

6. Add comments throughout your documents to note all changes. 

7. Test your hamburger menu icon on each page. Test your animation. 

8. Check your spelling. Validate your HTML file and correct any errors. 

> As a group, research other ways to use JavaScript within your website and summarize your findings.
