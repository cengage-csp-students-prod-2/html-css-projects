## Add the Text

Now it’s time to add the text to the code in the workspace panel.

> REMINDER: Make sure you have enabled “pop ups” on your device or you will not be able to see your work.

Copy the text below:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="header-container">
    <div class="header">
      <h1>Welcome to your course</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>What will you learn?</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Paste the text after `<body>` on line 9 of the _example.html_ file.

Select “Build example.html” to open the Simple Browser window and check your work.

> REMINDER: The first time you select “Build example.html,” the Simple Browser window will launch.
