## Perform the following tasks:
 
1. Open your *template.html* file and update the `nav` element to use an unordered list instead of a paragraph element for the links. Wrap each anchor within a list item. Remove any special characters used between navigation links. Make the same change to all HTML files used within your website. 

2. Create a style sheet for your website and save it within your */css* subfolder. Add a comment at the top of the style sheet that includes the **names** of team members in your group (firstname lastname), the **current date** (MM/DD/YYYY), and the **file name**.  

3. Add a CSS reset style rule as the first style rule in the style sheet. Include a comment above the style rule to note its purpose. Include all major selectors used within your website for your CSS reset.  

4. Update your HTML files and style sheet to make responsive images. This includes removing height and width attributes from image elements and creating a style rule that sets a `max-width` to **100%**. Also display image elements as a **block**. 

5. Link all of your webpages to your style sheet. Nest the `link` element within the `head` element, below the `meta` element. 

6. In your style sheet, create a minimum of 12 style rules. Style the `nav` to remove the bullet marker. Remove the underline from all links. Specify at least one `font-family` declaration and include fallback values. Include at least one `id` and one `class` selector. Use a high color contrast to ensure content is readable. Include comments to note where styles rules for `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer` begin.

7. Validate your style sheet and correct any errors. 

8. Review all pages within your website to ensure they appear as intended.
