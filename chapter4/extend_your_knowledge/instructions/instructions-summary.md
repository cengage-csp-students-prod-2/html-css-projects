In this exercise, you will create class selectors to style webpage content. You will use hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes in a style sheet, using a browser to find a color converter. The webpage includes empty paragraph elements and comments that contain questions. You will use the empty elements to answer questions noted within the webpage comments. An example of the completed webpage is shown in _Figure 4-79_.
