## Perform the following tasks: 

1. Open the *index.html* file and update the comment with **your name** (firstname lastname), the **file name**, and **todayâ€™s date** (MM/DD/YYYY). Link the *index.html* file to the style sheet located within the */css* folder.

2. Use your browser to find a CSS color picker and color converter (you can find one [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)). Use the color picker to find a shade of orange. Any orange color variation is fine. 

3. Open the *styles.css* file and locate the *Orange* comment. Below the comment, create a style rule for the class selector, `orange-hex`, that sets a background color to **orange** using a hexadecimal color value.

4. Create another style rule for the class selector, `orange-rgb`, that sets a background color to the same orange color created in *task 3*, but use an RGB color value instead of hexadecimal. Use a color converter to find the equivalent RGB color value.

5. Create another style rule for the class selector, `orange-hsl`, that sets a background color to the same orange color created in *task 3*, but use an HSL color value instead of hexadecimal. Use a color converter to find the equivalent HSL color value. 

6. Use the color picker to find a shade of purple. Any purple color variation is fine.

7. Locate the *Purple* comment in the *styles.css* file. Below the comment, create a style rule for the class selector, `purple-hex`, that sets a background color to **purple** using a hexadecimal color value.

8. Create another style rule for the class selector, `purple-rgb`, that sets a background color to the same purple color created in *task 7*, but use an RGB color value instead of hexadecimal. Use a color converter to find the equivalent RGB color value.

9. Create another style rule for the class selector, `purple-hsl`, that sets a background color to the same purple color created in *task 7*, but use an HSL color value instead of hexadecimal. Use a color converter to find the equivalent HSL color value.

10. Use the color picker to find a shade of green. Any green color variation is fine.

11. Locate the *Green* comment in the *styles.css* file. Below the comment, create a style rule for the class selector, `green-hex`, that sets a background color to **green** using a hexadecimal color value.

12. Create another style rule for the class selector, `green-rgb`, that sets a background color to the same green color created in *task 11*, but use an RGB color value instead of hexadecimal. Use a color converter to find the equivalent RGB color value.

13. Create another style rule for the class selector, `green-hsl`, that sets a background color to the same green color created in *task 11*, but use an HSL color value instead of hexadecimal. Use a color converter to find the equivalent HSL color value.

14. View the *index.html* in your browser.

15. In the *index.html* file, use a paragraph element to identify the online color converter you used to help complete this assignment. Include a link to your resource that opens in a new tab.

16. Use your browser to research the differences between hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL CSS color codes. Use a paragraph element to summarize your findings. 

17. Use a paragraph element to identify your preferred CSS color code format. 

18. Use a empty paragraph element to provide a summary of HWB color.

19. Use a empty paragraph element to provide a summary of CMYK color.

20. Validate the HTML and CSS files. Correct any errors.
