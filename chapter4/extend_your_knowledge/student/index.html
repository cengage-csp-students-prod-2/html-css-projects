                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: For the color conversion, I used the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools Color Picker</a> to find the RGB, HSL, and Hexadecimal values for the colors used in this assignment.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>HEX: Best for compactness and when you want to quickly define a color thatâ€™s widely supported. RGB: Ideal when you need to adjust or manipulate the color intensity directly in terms of red, green, and blue. HSL: Best for when you're working with color schemes and need to adjust lightness or saturation without changing the base color. </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: HSL CSS</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary:The HWB color model stands for Hue, Whiteness, and Blackness. It is similar to the HSL model, but instead of using saturation and lightness, it uses whiteness and blackness. In HWB, you define the hue (the base color), the amount of white (whiteness), and the amount of black (blackness). This allows for a simpler way of modifying colors based on how light or dark you want the color to be, providing a more direct way to achieve different shades of a color. </p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary: >CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black). It is a subtractive color model primarily used in color printing. In this model, colors are created by subtracting varying percentages of these four inks from the white color of the paper. The more ink is added, the darker the result. CMYK is ideal for printers as it reflects how colors mix when printed. Unlike RGB (used for screens), which is based on light emission, CMYK relies on ink absorption and light reflection.</p>
