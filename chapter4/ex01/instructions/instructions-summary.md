You work for a local music lesson company called Strike a Chord that provides music lessons for piano, guitar, and violin. The company needs a web presence and has hired you to create their website. You have already created the website plan and started creating the HTML pages in _Chapter 1_ through _3_. You now need to create a style sheet to format the website. The Home, Lessons, and Contact webpages are shown in _Figure 4-81a_, _Figure 4-81b_, _Figure 4-81c_.
