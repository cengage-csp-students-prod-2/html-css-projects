## Task 04
Add a blank line after the CSS reset style rule, add a comment with the text **Style rules for body and images**, and then create new style rules for the `body` and `img` selectors. 
* Create a style rule for the body selector that sets a background color value of **#f6eee4**.
* Create a style rule for the `img` selector that sets a `max-width` to **100%** and displays images as a `block`.
