## Task 07
Add a blank line after the `main` content style rules, add a comment with the text **Style rules for class and id selectors** and then create the style rules for the `.link`, `.action`, and `#contact` selectors:

* Create a style rule for the class selector `link` that sets the font color to **#4d3319**, removes the text decoration, sets the font weight value to **bold**, and sets the font style value to **italic**.
* Create a style rule for the class selector `action` that sets the font size to **1.75em**, sets the font weight value to **bold**, and aligns text **center**. 
* Create a style rule for the `id` selector `contact` that aligns text center. 

In the *about.html* file, within the `#info` `div` element, complete the following:
1. Add a class attribute with the value of `link` to the anchor element with the text *"National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association."*.
2. Remove the height and width attributes from the tortoise image (`img`) element.
3. Add a class attribute with the value of `action` to the paragraph element where the text is *"Did you find an injured or orphaned animal? Contact us to see if we can help."*.
