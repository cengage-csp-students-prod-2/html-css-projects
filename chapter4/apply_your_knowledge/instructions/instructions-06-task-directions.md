## Task 06
Add a blank line after the CSS reset style rule, add a comment with the text, **Style rule for body and image**, and then create new style rules for the `body` and `img` selectors.
* Create a style rule for the `body` selector that sets a background color value of `#e3eaf8`.
* Create a style rule for an `img` selector that sets a `max-width` to **100%** and displays the images as a `block`.
