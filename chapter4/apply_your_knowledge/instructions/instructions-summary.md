The group meets on a regular basis to update the standards. Many of these documents are known as working drafts. Instead of releasing C  S S versions, such as C S S 1 and 2, the group has changed its approach for C S S updates. The C S S Working Group has broken C S S into modules to define parts of C S S. The group now publishes C S S Snapshots, which include the latest updates to C S S. The group intends to publish these snapshots every one to two years. The latest C S S snapshot is C S S Snapshot 2018. Visit W 3 C for the latest C S S updates. In the first line of the paragraph, the text "C S S Working Group" is in bold, blue, and italics font. In the line before the last one, the text, "C S S Snapshot 2018" follows the same font style. In the last line, the text "W 3 C" also follows the same font style.' />
