You and several of your classmates have been tasked with creating a website that showcases advancements in technology. You have already created the website plan and started creating the HTML pages for the technology website in *Chapter 1* through *Chapter 3*. You now need to create a style sheet to format the website. 

## Perform the following tasks: 
1. Open your *template.html* file and update the `nav` element to use an unordered list instead of a paragraph element for the links. Wrap each anchor within a list item. Remove any special characters used between navigation links. Make the same change to all HTML files used within your website. 

2. Create a style sheet for your website your *css* folder. Add a comment at the top of the style sheet that includes the name of each team member, the **current date**, and the **file name**.

3. Add a CSS reset style rule as the first style rule in the style sheet. Include a comment above the style rule to note its purpose. Include all major selectors used within your website for your CSS reset. 

5. Update your HTML files and style sheet to make responsive images. This includes removing `height` and `width` attributes from image elements and creating a style rule that sets a `max-width` to **100%**. Also display image elements as a **block**.

6. Add a hero image to the home page for your website. You may use the *tech-banner.png* data file provided or another file that suits your needs. 

7. Link all of your webpages to your style sheet. Nest the `link` element within the `head` element, below the `meta` element.

8. In your style sheet, create a minimum of 15 style rules. Style the `nav` to remove the bullet marker. Include at least one id and one class selector. Use a `span` element. Specify at least one `font-family` declaration and include fallback values. Use a high color contrast to ensure the content is readable. Include comments to note where styles rules for header, nav, main, and footer begin. 9. Research a CSS property not discussed in Chapter 4 and use it within one of your style rules. Include a comment to note which declaration contains the property you found and its purpose.

10. Validate your style sheet and correct any errors.

11. Review all pages within your website to ensure each appears as intended.
