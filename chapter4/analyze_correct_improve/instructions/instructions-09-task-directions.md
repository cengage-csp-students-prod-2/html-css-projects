## Task 09
Create a style rule for anchor elements within the `main` element that sets the font color value to **#47476b**, removes the underline, sets a `font-weight` value of **bold**, and sets a font style value of **italic**.

Adjust the `width` value for the `cssl`, `css2`, and `css3` `id` selectors so that they appear next to each other horizontally.
