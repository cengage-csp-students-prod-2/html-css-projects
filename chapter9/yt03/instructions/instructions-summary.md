You and several of your classmates have been tasked with creating a website that showcases advances in technology. You have already created a responsive design website and now need to add audio and video to the website.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. As a team, discuss the best page to integrate audio. You may create an audio file or research the Internet for royalty-free audio resources.

2. Upload the audio file to your **media** folder and create two audio files, using the **MP3** and **Ogg** file formats. Compress any audio files larger than **12 MB**. Add the `audio` element with controls to a webpage within your website. Provide fallback text for legacy browsers that do not support the audio element.

3. As a team, discuss the best page to integrate video. Find or take pictures and/or video of technologies and use them to create a video to use within your website. You can use Microsoft Photos, Apple iMovie, or another software application of your choice.

4. The video should include at least five pictures or video clips. Add music and voice audio to your video. Keep the video brief, 45 seconds or less.

5. Upload your video as a **MP4**. Find an online converter and create a **WebM** file as well.

6. Compress your video files if they are larger than **12 MB**.

7. Use the `video` element to add your video to a webpage within your website. Include the controls and poster attributes. Include two `source` elements. Provide fallback text for legacy browsers that do not support the video element.

8. Create captions and descriptions files. Start files for your captions and descriptions have been provided.

9. Use the `track` element to add the captions and descriptions files to the `video` element. View your video with captions using Web Server for Chrome or by publishing your website.

10. Review the captions to ensure that the timecodes are accurate and make any necessary adjustments.

11. Open the _styles.css_ file in your text editor. Add the `video` selector to the CSS Reset style rule. Add the `video` selector to the `img` style rule as well.

12. Review your files for best coding practices; ensure proper spacing and indents for improved readability.

13. Check your spelling. Validate all HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.
