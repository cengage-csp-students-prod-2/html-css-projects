## Task 03
In the `guitar` `section` within the *lessons.html* file, after the paragraph element, insert two new blank lines and then add an **h4** element with the text, **Guitar Winter Performance**.

Below the `h4` element, add an **audio** element with the **controls**   attribute.

Nest a **source** element within the `audio` element that specifies the **media/guitar.mp3**  as the `src`  file and  **audio/mp3** as the `type`.
Nest another **source** element that specifies the **media/guitar.ogg** as the `src` file and **audio/ogg** as the `type`.

Below the `source` element, provide fallback text for legacy browsers that do not support the `audio` element.
