You have already developed a responsive website for your personal portfolio and now need to add audio to the website. 

## Perform the following tasks:
1. Open your *portfolio* folder and create a new subfolder named **media**.

2. Add the `audio` element to one of your webpages. Review your webpages to determine which page will use the `audio` element.
 
3. Determine which attributes to include for the `audio` element. Include at least two source files. You may use an existing audio file that you have, you may create an audio file, or you can research the Internet for a free audio resource, such as *freemusicarchive.com*.

4. Provide fallback text for legacy browsers that do not support the video element.  

5. Test your files.  

6. Validate and correct your HTML file as needed. 

> Discuss the reasons you should or should not include audio on your portfolio webpage.
