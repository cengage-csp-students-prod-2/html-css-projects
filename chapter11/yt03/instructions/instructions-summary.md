You and several of your classmates have been tasked with creating a website that showcases advances in technology. You have already created a responsive design website and now need to prepare the website for SEO and publish it.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. Review the `title` element on all pages and update as appropriate.

2. Add a unique description `meta` tag to every page within the website.

3. Identify and discuss two social networking websites that the website could use to promote the future technologies website. Use your browser to search for and download the social media icon logos (brand assets) directly from the social networking company. For example, if you want to download the icons for Facebook, search for Facebook brand assets. If necessary, use basic image editing software, such as Paint, to resize the image. Review the brand asset guidelines to learn the minimum image dimensions.

4. Add two social media icons to the `footer` element on every page within the website and include a link for both. You may use generic links to the social networking website, such as *https://www.facebook.com*.

5. Use your style sheet to style the social media icons as desired for each viewport.

6. Create a sitemap file for your website. Use *www.exampledomain.com* as the domain.

7. Create and style a **Skip to Content** link on each page.

8. Create a new file named _styles.min.css_. Minify your CSS and save it in the _styles.min.css_ file. Be sure to keep your original _styles.css_ file. Update the stylesheet link within every HTML file to use the minified CSS file.

9. Publish your website.
