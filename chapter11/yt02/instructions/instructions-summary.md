You have already developed a responsive website for the dog grooming website and now need to prepare the HTML files for SEO and publish the website.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. Review the `title` element on all pages and update as appropriate.

2. Add a unique description `meta` tag to every page within the website.

3. Identify two social networking websites that you can use to promote the business. Use your browser to search for and download the social media icon logos (brand assets) directly from the social networking company. For example, if you want to download the icons for Facebook, search for Facebook brand assets. If necessary, use basic image editing software, such as Paint, to resize the image. Review the brand asset guidelines to learn the minimum image dimensions.

4. Add two social media icons to the footer element on every page within the website and include a link for both. You may use generic links to the social networking website, such as *https://www.facebook.com*.

5. Use your style sheet to style the social media icons as desired for each viewport.

6. Create a sitemap file for your website. Use *www.exampledomain.com* as the domain.

7. Minify your CSS and save it with the file name _styles.min.css_. Be sure to keep your original styles.css file. Update the stylesheet link within every HTML file to use the minified CSS file.

8. Publish your website.
