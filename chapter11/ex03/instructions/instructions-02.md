## Peform the following tasks: 
1. Review the `title` element on all pages and update as appropriate.

2. Add a unique description `meta` tag to every page within the website.

3. Identify and discuss two social networking websites that the website could use to promote student events and activities. Use your browser to search for and download the social media icon logos (brand assets) directly from the social networking company. For example, if you want to download the icons for Facebook, search for Facebook brand assets. If necessary, use basic image editing software, such as Paint, to resize the image. Review the brand asset guidelines to learn the minimum image dimensions.

4. Add two social media icons to the `footer` element on every page within the website and include a link for both. You may use generic links to the social networking website, such as *https://www.facebook.com* .

5. Use your style sheet to style the social media icons as desired for each viewport.

6. Create a sitemap file for your website. Use *www.exampledomain.com* as the domain.

7. Create and style a *Skip to Content* link on each page.

8. Create a new file named **styles.min.css**. Minify your CSS and save it to the *styles.min.css* file. Be sure to keep your original *styles.css* file. Update the stylesheet link within every HTML file to use the minified CSS file.

10. Use the "Open in Browser Tab" button, next to the embedded browser's address bar, to launch your website in a new browser tab and obtain a unique URL. Alternatively, you can publish your website files to a remote server.

> In this exercise, you downloaded and added social media icons or brand assets to your website. Research “Facebook brand assets,” review their guidelines, and summarize your findings.
