You work for a local music lesson company called Strike a Chord that provides music lessons for piano, guitar, and violin. The company needs a web presence and has hired you to create their website. You have already created the website and now need to modify the `title` element on each page, add a `meta` tag and set a description to each HTML page, add social media icons to each page, and publish the website. **Figure 11-63** shows the social media icons on the published website, as displayed in a desktop browser.
