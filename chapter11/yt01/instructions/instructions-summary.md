You have already developed a responsive website for your personal portfolio and now need to modify your HTML files for SEO and publish your website.

## Perform the following tasks:

1. Review the `title` element on all pages and update as appropriate.

2. Add a unique description `meta` tag to every page within the website.

3. Determine at least one social media icon that you can add to your website to promote your skills and experience. Use your browser to search for and download the social media icon logos (brand assets) directly from the social networking company. For example, if you want to download the icons for Facebook, search for Facebook brand assets. If necessary, use basic image editing software, such as Paint, to resize the image. Review the brand asset guidelines to learn the minimum image dimensions.

4. Add at least one social media icon to the `footer` element on every page within your website, and include a link to the icon. You may use a generic link to the social networking website, such as *https://www.linkedin.com*.

5. Use your style sheet to style the social media icon as desired for each viewport.

6. Publish your website.
