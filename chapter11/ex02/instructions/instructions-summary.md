You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already created the website and now need to prepare the website for SEO, add a Skip to Content link, and publish it. _Figure 11-64_ shows the social media icons on the published website, as displayed in a desktop browser.
