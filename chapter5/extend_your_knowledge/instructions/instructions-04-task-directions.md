## Task 04
In the *styles.css* file, locate the “fixed” comment and create a style rule for the `fixed` class selector with the following declarations: 

* Add a declaration for the `position` property with a value of **fixed**.
* Add another declaration for the `top` property and specify a value of **90px**.
* Add another declaration for the `right` property with a value of **10px**.

Refresh your page, and scroll down to view the changes. In the *index.html* file, use the empty paragraph element within the `fixed` `div`  element to explain how the style rules affected the `fixed` box.
