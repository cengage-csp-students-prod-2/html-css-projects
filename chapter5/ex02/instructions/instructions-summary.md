You volunteer at a local wildlife rescue, a nonprofit organization called Wild Rescues. The organization rescues all kinds of wild animals, rehabilitates them, and then releases them back into the wild. Wild Rescues needs a website to help raise awareness about the organization. You have already created several pages for the website and made a style sheet, but now you need to design the website for a mobile viewport. The Home, About Us, and Contact webpages are shown in _Figure 5-69_.
